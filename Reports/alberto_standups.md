# Alberto's Daily Standup Routine

## 04-12

 -  Created the README, including stylizing it!
 
## 04-16

 -  Did a lot of research as well as investigating to find a way to incorporate the API's from various sites (Twitter and Reddit) into our own project 
 - Riley also taught me how to do [THIS!](https://google.com)


## 04-22

 - Today was a very busy class day! I spent a good amount of time  continuing trying to figure out how to incorporate Reddit (specifically!) With luck, I came across [snoowrap](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/snoowrap) which is a wrapper, able to access the Reddit site! I ran out of time for today, but I know I need to incorporate [oauth](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/reddit-oauth-helper) for next class, to be able to create a fully functional Reddit site (hopefully)! A challenge I'm facing is researching a bunch of new terms that I have never heard of before, as well as incorporating these new terms into my project.

## 04-25

- I got the client side of snoowrap to work (authenticating my login and everything!). Now, I need to work on actually displaying reddit itself.

## 04-26

- Today, I spent a large amount of class-time on researching on snoowrap actually displaying the actual code itself! This is definately becoming a challenge moving forward!

## 03-30

- I commmuncated snoowrap itself, using Riley's "suggestions" of first learning what commands I can actually do (learning snoowrap itself), with the hope of actually implementing these commands into a HTML later.


## 04-01

- Today, following Riley's otheer suggestion today, I started eperimenting with some of the code itself in snoowrap! I did a lot of trial and error, but I unfortunately did not get the code to work. However, I did definately get more familiar with the code itself!



## 04-03 

- I got to study the program itself more, as well as continue looking more wrappers!


## 04-08

- Presented in class!
- Worked on styling with Ezra (being able to make images bigger when hovering over it)


## 04-16

- Added the ability to be able to change subreddit without reloading the page!


## 04-17

- Helped Jack with running functions in his Twitter API



## 04-22
- Worked on the style sheet so it looks like the Reddit one!
