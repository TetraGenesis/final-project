# Researched Twitter's API
Looked into making a developer Twitter account, as well as creating an email for our project that we can create social media accounts under so we can access APIs.

# 4/22/19: The Phantom Menace
Applied for twitter dev account
Researched more about twitter and reddit API
Plan to create a reddit account, with which we will use to send requests

# 4/25/19: Attack of the Clones
Created a Twitter app, found a javascript library for twitter's API, and got access tokens and keys.  They are a random, long string of letters.  Who could have guessed that?

# 4/26/19: Star Wars: The Clone Wars
Kept working on editing the boiler plate of the library to custom fit our needs, but ran into a really annoying 404. Progress is slow but steady.

# 4/30/19: Revenge of the Sith
Not even riley could see what was wrong because of the lack of a debugger, making the library take way more time than it is worth.  Switched to a new library though!

# 5/1/19: Solo: A Star Wars Story
Found a great new library, but need mocha to run it.  However, my computer is fighting me with permission to install it.  It is saying that I need to be an admin.  Well, Riley fixed that with sudo, but still working on running the test.

# 5/3/19: Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
Found a new API, hopefully it works this time.  *sigh*

# 5/8/19: A New Hope
So that one didn't work.  What a surprise.  However, a new library shows promise, so much so that Riley wants to see it and asked me to email it to him.  

# 5/14/19: The Empire Strikes Back
A little progress what made, and I was able to input and control what the index html displayed.

# 5/22/19 Return of the Jedi
Got bootstrap working to format the twitter page
